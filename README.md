### Project Title
Project Title: Bike Share Analysis

### Description
Description: This project analyzes bike share data from three major cities and provides insights on usage patterns, popular stations, and trip duration.

Usage Patterns: You can analyze the frequency of bike rides during different times of the day, days of the week, or months of the year. This can help identify peak usage periods and understand user behavior.

Popular Stations: You can determine the most frequently used start and end stations, as well as the most common routes taken by riders. This information can be useful for optimizing bike station locations and managing bike availability.

Trip Duration: You can analyze the distribution of trip durations and calculate statistics such as average trip duration and the longest/shortest trips. This can provide insights into user preferences and help identify outliers or anomalies.
